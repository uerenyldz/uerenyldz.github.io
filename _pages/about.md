Hi, my name is Umut Eren Yıldız, and you are reading my bio so thank you for the interest!

I am from Istanbul, Turkey originally. Although, I live in Ankara for a while due to my academic education.I have been in many places in Turkey for entertainment and educational purposes.

I am a senior year mining engineering student at METU. I both worked governmental level and corporated companies at the mineral processing field. You can look into my CV to see what kind of internships that I have completed and could go to my blog to see my works and studies to examine in more detail. After completing my labratory work at Ankara, now I am in Manisa that I conduct my mineral processing facility work in Meta Nickel Cobalt I.C. that is a subgroup of Zorlu Corp.
