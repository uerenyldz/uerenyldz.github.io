I'm a second year PhD student at University of Maryland, College Park Computer
Science Department.

I work with Leonidas Lampropoulos on the intersection of Property Based Testing,
Fuzzing and Formal Verification.

We are using Programming Languages techniques to advance testing and verification of software artifacts.
